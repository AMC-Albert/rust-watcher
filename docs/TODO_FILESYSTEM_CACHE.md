# TODO: Filesystem Cache Implementation

## Status Update (June 2025)
- Core event log and cache storage: complete and stable. All legacy migration, schema redesign, and scaffolding tasks are finished and no longer tracked here.
- Filesystem cache is modular, robust, and warning-free. All integration and stress tests pass except for explicitly unimplemented multi-watch scenarios (not a regression).
- Documentation and comments are up to date for all implemented features. Pending features are only in this TODO and design docs.
- Unified/cross-watch queries, hierarchical operations, and pattern-based search are implemented and tested.
- **Cache synchronizer integrated with watcher event loop. Incremental cache updates on all events. Borrow checker and trait bound issues resolved.**
- **Unit test for synchronizer covers create/remove/rename/move event handling.**
- All build, test, and clippy checks are clean as of latest commit.
- See commit history for details of modularization, bugfixes, and groundwork for advanced features (June 2025).
- **UPDATE (June 2025):** Event type is now stored with every node. All mutation and repair logic is event-type aware. Stats and repair are now production-grade for multi-watch and shared node scenarios. Per-type stats repair is now accurate. No further manual intervention required for this migration.
- **Pattern-based search/filtering:** Now uses prefix index for efficient prefix queries (e.g., `foo*`). Suffix/infix patterns (e.g., `*.txt`, `*a.*`) still require O(N) scan. This is a hard schema limitation; further optimization would require a new index on file name or extension. All code and tests are up to date as of June 2025.

## Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Filesystem Cache API (incomplete)
- [ ] **PRIORITY: Scalable stats/indexing: per-watch, per-path, and advanced indexing**
- [ ] **PRIORITY: Multi-watch correctness: expand integration and stress tests, improve invalidation and consistency for overlapping/shared nodes**
- [ ] Performance operations: bulk cache warming, background maintenance, statistics/monitoring, memory optimization
- [ ] Integration with existing systems: watcher integration, cache-aware monitoring, database adapter enhancements
- [ ] Advanced features: transaction coordination, memory management, performance monitoring
- [ ] Testing and validation: expand unit/integration tests for cache synchronization, especially for multi-watch scenarios.

## Completed: Cache Synchronization Layer (June 2025)

- Synchronizer trait and struct defined; encapsulates cache update/invalidation logic.
- Fully integrated into watcher event processing pipeline.
- Robust handling for all event types: create, modify, remove, move/rename.
- Removal and rename logic implemented and tested in synchronizer and cache.
- Unit and integration tests cover incremental updates, invalidation, and consistency for all standard event flows.
- Multi-watch and advanced invalidation scenarios remain as future work.
