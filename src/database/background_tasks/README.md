# Background Tasks Module

This module provides a scalable, extensible framework for running background maintenance and health tasks in the database layer.

- `manager.rs`: Core task manager and trait definitions
- `impls.rs`: Concrete maintenance task implementations (e.g., compaction, index repair)
- `mod.rs`: Module interface

## Usage

Register tasks with the manager at startup, then call `start()` to launch all background jobs. See code comments for extension points and known limitations.
